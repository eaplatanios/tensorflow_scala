/** Hook to extend calls to `MonitoredSession.run()`.
  *
  * [[Hook]]s are useful to track training, report progress, request early stopping and more. They use the observer
  * pattern and notify at the following points:
  *   - When a session starts being used,
  *   - Before a call to [[Session.run()]],
  *   - After a call to [[Session.run()]],
  *   - When the session stops being used.
  *
  * A [[Hook]] encapsulates a piece of reusable/composable computation that can piggyback a call to
  * `MonitoredSession.run()`. A hook can add any feeds/fetches/targets to the run call, and when the run call finishes
  * executing with success, the hook gets the fetches it requested. Hooks are allowed to add ops to the graph in the
  * `begin()` method. The graph is finalized after the `begin()` method is called.
  *
  * There are a few pre-defined hooks that can be used without modification:
  *   - `StopHook`: Requests to stop iterating based on the provided stopping criteria.
  *   - `StepRateHook`: Logs and/or saves summaries with the number of steps executed per second.
  *   - `TensorLoggingHook`: Logs the values of one or more tensors.
  *   - `SummarySaverHook`: Saves summaries to the provided summary writer.
  *   - `CheckpointSaverHook`: Saves checkpoints (i.e., copy of the graph along with the trained variable values).
  *   - `TensorNaNHook`: Requests to stop iterating if the provided tensor contains `NaN` values.
  *
  * For more specific needs you can create custom hooks. For example:
  * {{{
  *   class ExampleHook extends Hook[Output, Unit, Tensor] {
  *     private[this] val logger: Logger = Logger(LoggerFactory.getLogger("Example Hook"))
  *     private[this] var exampleTensor: Output
  *
  *     override def begin(): Unit = {
  *       // You can add ops to the graph here.
  *       logger.info("Starting the session.")
  *       exampleTensor = ...
  *     }
  *
  *     override def afterSessionCreation(session: Session): Unit = {
  *       // When this is called, the graph is finalized and ops can no longer be added to it.
  *       logger.info("Session created.")
  *     }
  *
  *     override def beforeSessionRun[F, E, R](runContext: SessionRunContext[F, E, R])(implicit
  *       executableEv: Executable[E],
  *       fetchableEv: Fetchable.Aux[F, R]
  *      ): Hook.SessionRunArgs[Output, Unit, Tensor] = {
  *        logger.info("Before calling `Session.run()`.")
  *        Hook.SessionRunArgs(fetches = exampleTensor)
  *      }
  *
  *      override def afterSessionRun[F, E, R](runContext: SessionRunContext[F, E, R], runValues: Tensor)(implicit
  *        executableEv: Executable[E],
  *        fetchableEv: Fetchable.Aux[F, R]
  *      ): Unit = {
  *        logger.info("Done running one step. The value of the tensor is: ${runValues.summarize()}")
  *        if (needToStop)
  *          runContext.requestStop()
  *      }
  *
  *      override def end(session: Session): Unit = {
  *        logger.info("Done with the session.")
  *      }
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * To understand how hooks interact with calls to `MonitoredSession.run()`, look at following code:
  * {{{
  *   val session = Estimator.monitoredTrainingSession(hooks = someHook, ...)
  *   while (!session.shouldStop)
  *     session.run(...)
  *   session.close()
  * }}}
  *
  * The above user code loosely leads to the following execution:
  * {{{
  *   someHook.begin()
  *   val session = tf.Session()
  *   someHook.afterSessionCreation()
  *   while (!stopRequested) {
  *     someHook.beforeSessionRun(...)
  *     try {
  *       val result = session.run(mergedSessionRunArgs)
  *       someHook.afterSessionRun(..., result)
  *     } catch {
  *       case _: OutOfRangeException => stopRequested = true
  *     }
  *   }
  *   someHook.end()
  *   session.close()
  * }}}
  *
  * Note that if `session.run()` throws an [[OutOfRangeException]] then `someHook.afterSessionRun()` will not be
  * called, but `someHook.end()` will still be called. On the other hand, if `session.run()` throws any other exception,
  * then neither `someHook.afterSessionRun()` nor `someHook.end()` will be called.
  *
