/** A key-value store using deterministic reservoir sampling.
  *
  * Items are added with an associated key. Items may be retrieved by the corresponding key, and a list of keys can also
  * be retrieved. If `maxSize` is not zero, then it dictates the maximum number of items that will be stored for each
  * key. Once there are more items for a given key, they are replaced via reservoir sampling, such that each item has an
  * equal probability of being included in the sample.
  *
  * Deterministic means that for any given seed and bucket size, the sequence of values that are kept for any given key
  * will always be the same, and that this is independent of any insertions for other keys. That is:
  *
  * {{{
  *   val reservoirA = ReservoirKVStore(10)
  *   val reservoirB = ReservoirKVStore(10)
  *   (0 until 100).foreach(i => reservoirA.add("key1", i))
  *   (0 until 100).foreach(i => reservoirA.add("key2", i))
  *   (0 until 100).foreach(i => {
  *     reservoirB.add("key1", i)
  *     reservoirB.add("key2", i)
  *   })
  * }}}
  *
  * After executing this code, `reservoirA` and `reservoirB` will be in identical states.
  *
  * For more information on reservoir sampling, refer to [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling).
  *
  * Note that, adding items has amortized `O(1)` runtime cost.
  *
  * @param  maxSize        Maximum size of each bucket in this reservoir key-value store.
  * @param  seed           Seed to use for the random number generator used while sampling.
  * @param  alwaysKeepLast Boolean flag indicating whether to always store the last seen item. If set to `true` and the
  *                        last seen item was not sampled to be stored, then it replaces the last item in the
  *                        corresponding bucket.
