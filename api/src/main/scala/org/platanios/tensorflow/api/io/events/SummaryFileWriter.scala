/** Writes `Summary` protocol buffers to event files for use with TensorBoard.
  *
  * The [[SummaryFileWriter]] class provides a mechanism to create an event file in a given directory and add summaries
  * and events to it. The class updates the file contents asynchronously. This allows a training program to call methods
  * to add data to the file directly from the training loop, without slowing down training.
  *
  * On construction the summary writer creates a new event file in `workingDir`. This event file will contain `Event`
  * protocol buffers constructed when you call one of the following functions: `writeGraph()`, `writeSummary()`,
  * `writeSessionLog()`, or `writeRunMetadata()`.
  *
  * If you pass a `Graph` to the constructor it is write to the event file, which is equivalent to calling
  * `writeGraph()` later on.
  *
  * TensorBoard will pick up the graph from the file and display it graphically so you can interactively explore it. You
  * will usually pass the graph from the session in which you launched it:
  * {{{
  *   // Create a graph.
  *   val graph = Graph()
  *   ...
  *   // Launch the graph in a session.
  *   val session = Session(graph)
  *   // Create a summary file writer and add the graph to the event file.
  *   val writer = SummaryWriter(workingDir, session.graph)
  * }}}
  *
  * @param  workingDir     Directory in which to write the event file.
  * @param  graph          Graph to write to the event file when constructing the summary file writer.
  * @param  queueCapacity  Maximum number of events pending to be written to disk before a call to `write()` blocks.
  * @param  flushFrequency Specifies how often to flush the written events to disk (in seconds).
  * @param  filenameSuffix Filename suffix to use for the event file.
