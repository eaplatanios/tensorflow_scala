/** RNN cell that is composed by applying a sequence of RNN cells in order.
  *
  * This means that the output of each RNN is fed to the next one as input, while the states remain separate.
  *
  * Note that this class does no variable management at all. Variable sharing should be handled based on the RNN cells
  * the caller provides to this class. The learn API provides a layer version of this class that also does some
  * management of the variables involved.
  *
  * @param  cells Cells being stacked together.
  * @param  name  Name prefix used for all new ops.
