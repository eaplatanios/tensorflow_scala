/** Writes `Event` protocol buffers to files.

  * The `EventFileWriter` class creates an event file in the specified directory and asynchronously writes `Event`
  * protocol buffers to it. The file is encoded using the `TFRecord` format, which is similar to `RecordIO`.
  *
  * On construction the event file writer creates a new event file in `workingDir`. This event file will contain `Event`
  * protocol buffers, which are written to disk via the `EventFileWriter.write()` method.
  *
  * @param  workingDir     Directory in which to write the event file.
  * @param  queueCapacity  Maximum number of events pending to be written to disk before a call to `write()` blocks.
  * @param  flushFrequency Specifies how often to flush the written events to disk (in seconds).
  * @param  filenameSuffix Filename suffix to use for the event file.
