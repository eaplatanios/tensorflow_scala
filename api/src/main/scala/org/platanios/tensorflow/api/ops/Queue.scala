/** Class that supports all TensorFlow queue implementations.
  *
  * A queue is a TensorFlow data structure that stores tensors across multiple steps, and exposes operations that
  * enqueue and dequeue tensors.
  *
  * Each queue element is a sequence/tuple of one or more tensors, where each tuple component has a static data type,
  * and may have a statically-known shape. The queue implementations support versions of enqueue and dequeue that handle
  * single elements and versions that support enqueuing and dequeuing many elements at once.
  *
  * @param  handle    Handle to the underlying TensorFlow queue.
  * @param  dataTypes Sequence of data types for each element in the queue (an element is a tuple of tensors).
  * @param  shapes    Sequence of shapes for each element in the queue (an element is a tuple of tensors).
