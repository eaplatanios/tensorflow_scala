# 0.1.2 Minor Updates

In this release we have:

  - Removed the layer creation context mechanism, to be refactored
    later. It was causing some issues due to bad design and unclear
    semantics. The plan is to implement this, in the near future, as
    wrapper creation context layers.
  - Fixed a bug that was causing some issues related to inference
    hooks in the in-memory estimator.
  - Added support for some new image-related ops, under the namespace
    `tf.image`.
  - Improved consistency for the creation of initializer ops.
  - Improved logging in the learn API.
