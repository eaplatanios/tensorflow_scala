    * Operations that rely on a random seed actually derive it from two seeds:
    * the graph-level and operation-level seeds. This sets the graph-level seed.
    *
    * Its interactions with operation-level seeds is as follows:
    *
    *   1. If neither the graph-level nor the operation seed is set:
    *     A random seed is used for this op.
    *   2. If the graph-level seed is set, but the operation seed is not:
    *     The system deterministically picks an operation seed in conjunction
    *     with the graph-level seed so that it gets a unique random sequence.
    *   3. If the graph-level seed is not set, but the operation seed is set:
    *     A default graph-level seed and the specified operation seed are used to
    *     determine the random sequence.
    *   4. If both the graph-level and the operation seed are set:
    *     Both seeds are used in conjunction to determine the random sequence.
    *
    * @param seed The new graph-level random seed.
