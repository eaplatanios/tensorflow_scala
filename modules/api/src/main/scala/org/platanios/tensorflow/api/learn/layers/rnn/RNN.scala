  * @param  name               Name scope (also acting as variable scope) for this layer.
  * @param  cell               RNN cell to use.
  * @param  initialState       Initial state to use for the RNN, which is a structure over tensors with shapes
  *                            `[batchSize, stateShape(i)(0), stateShape(i)(1), ...]`, where `i` corresponds to the
  *                            index of the corresponding state. Defaults to a zero state.
  * @param  timeMajor          Boolean value indicating whether the inputs are provided in time-major format (i.e.,
  *                            have shape `[time, batch, depth]`) or in batch-major format (i.e., have shape
  *                            `[batch, time, depth]`).
  * @param  parallelIterations Number of RNN loop iterations allowed to run in parallel.
  * @param  swapMemory         If `true`, GPU-CPU memory swapping support is enabled for the RNN loop.
  * @param  sequenceLengths    Optional tensor with shape `[batchSize]` containing the sequence lengths for
  *                            each row in the batch.
