/** RNN cell that applies dropout to the provided RNN cell.
  *
  * Note that currently, a different dropout mask is used for each time step in an RNN (i.e., not using the variational
  * recurrent dropout method described in
  * ["A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in Recurrent Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05287).
  *
  * Note also that for LSTM cells, no dropout is applied to the memory tensor of the state. It is only applied to the
  * state tensor.
  *
  * @param  name                  Name scope (also acting as variable scope) for this layer.
  * @param  cell                  RNN cell on which to perform dropout.
  * @param  inputKeepProbability  Keep probability for the input of the RNN cell.
  * @param  outputKeepProbability Keep probability for the output of the RNN cell.
  * @param  stateKeepProbability  Keep probability for the output state of the RNN cell.
  * @param  seed                  Optional random seed, used to generate a random seed pair for the random number
  *                               generator, when combined with the graph-level seed.
