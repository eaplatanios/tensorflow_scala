  /** @define OpDocStatisticsSufficientStatistics
    *   The `sufficientStatistics` op calculates the sufficient statistics for the mean and variance of `input`.
    *
    *   These sufficient statistics are computed using a one pass algorithm on an input that's optionally shifted.

    * @define OpDocStatisticsMomentsFromSufficientStatistics
    *   The `momentsFromSufficientStatistics` op calculates mean and variance based on some sufficient statistics.
    *
    *   This function can be directly applied to the values that the [[sufficientStatistics]] function returns.
    *
    * @define OpDocStatisticsMoments
    *   The `moments` op calculates the mean and variance of `input`, across the `axes` dimensions.
    *
    *   The mean and variance are calculated by aggregating the contents of `input` across `axes`. If `input` is 1-D and
    *   `axes = [0]` this is just the mean and variance of a vector.
    *
    *   When using these moments for batch normalization:
    *     - for so-called "global normalization", used with convolutional filters with shape
    *       `[batch, height, width, depth]`, pass `axes = [0, 1, 2]`.
    *     - for simple batch normalization pass `axes = [0]` (batch only).
