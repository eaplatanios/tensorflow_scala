# Contributing

It would be awesome if people could contribute to this library. Given
its scope and its early state, before I settle on the API for some of
the features, I would really appreciate contributions on the following:

  - **Unit Tests:** Currently unit tests are missing for a big part of
    the library and it would be extremely useful if we had those.
  - **Examples:** Examples of code using the library would be great and
    would also make issues come up early so they can be fixed.
