# Release 0.4.1

Fixed the precompiled TensorFlow binaries, and also added the following
new features:

  - `io` module:
    - Added support for a new `TFRecordWriter`.
  - `ops` module:
    - Added a new ops namespace, `sparse`, that includes all sparse ops.
    - Added support for `sparse.reorder` and `sparse.merge`.
    - Added support for parsing TF records.
    - `data` module:
      - Added support for `Dataset.shuffleAndRepeat`.
    - `optimizers` module:
      - Added support for the Adafactor optimizer.
      - Renamed `SqrtDecay` to `RSqrtDecay` which is more appropriate.
    - `math` module:
      - Added support for `batchGather`.
      - Added support for bitwise ops.
    - `rnn` module:
      - Simplified the attention mechanisms functionality so that it is
        now not required to tile memory tensors for beam search outside
        the beam search decoder.
    - Moved the `seq2seq` module to a separate repository (that of
      [Symphony Machine Translation](https://github.com/eaplatanios/symphony-mt)).
