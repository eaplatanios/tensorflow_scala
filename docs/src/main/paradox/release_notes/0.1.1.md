# Release 0.1.1

This release fixes the following bugs:

  - Issue with the packaged pre-compiled TensorFlow binaries that
    affected Linux platforms.
  - Learn API bug where the shared name of input iterators was being
    set incorrectly.

I also switched to using CircleCI for continuous integration, instead
of TravisCI.
