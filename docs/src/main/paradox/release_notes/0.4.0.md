# Release 0.4.0

This is a major release with a lot of new features related to static
types for tensors and ops. The graph construction API is now
statically-typed, thus enabling much better type safety than before.

Tensors and outputs are now statically-typed and the types used are the
Scala types that correspond to the tensors' TensorFlow data types. For
example:

```scala
val t1 = Tensor(0.5, 1) // The inferred type is Tensor[Double].
val t2 = Tensor(1, 2)   // The inferred type is Tensor[Int].
val t3 = t1 + t2        // The inferred type is Tensor[Double].
val t4 = t3.isNaN       // The inferred type is Tensor[Boolean].
val t5 = t3.any()       // Fails at compile-time because `any()` is only
                        // supported for Tensor[Boolean].
```

A similar situation now applies to `Output`s. `Op`s are also typed and
so is the auto-differentiation implementation.

This resulted in major simplifications in the data pipeline and the high
level learn API. Datasets and dataset iterators do not "carry" `T`, `V`,
`D`, and `S` types with them now, but rather just the type of the
elements they contain/produce.

A new type trait called `TF` is also introduced that denotes supported
Scala types in TensorFlow (e.g., `TF[Int]` and `TF[Float]`). Similarly,
some more type traits are introduced to denote type constraints for
various ops (e.g., `IsIntOrUInt[Int]`, `IsIntOrUInt[Long]`,
`IsFloatOrDouble[Float]`, etc.). These type traits are powered by a
general implementation of union types for Scala.

Other new features include:

  - `data` module:
    - Added support for the `mapAndBatch` transformation.
