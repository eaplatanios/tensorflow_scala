# Release 0.3.0

With this release we have finally added support for static data type
information for tensors (not for symbolic tensors yet though -- for now
we effectively have support for a statically-typed version of `numpy`
for Scala). This is an important milestone and contributes significantly
to type safety, which can help catch errors at compile time, rather than
runtime. For example:

```scala
val t1 = Tensor(0.5, 1) // The inferred type is Tensor[FLOAT64].
val t2 = Tensor(1, 2)   // The inferred type is Tensor[INT32].
val t3 = t1 + t2        // The inferred type is Tensor[FLOAT64].
val t4 = t3.isNaN       // The inferred type is Tensor[BOOLEAN].
val t5 = t3.any()       // Fails at compile-time because `any()` is only
                        // supported for Tensor[BOOLEAN].
```

Other new features include:

- Improvements to the high-level learn API:
  - Layers can now provide and use their own parameter generator, and
    can also access the current training step
    (using `Layer.currentStep`).
  - Layers now support `.map(...)`.
  - Added support for batch normalization.
- Added support for `tf.logSigmoid` and `tf.lrn`.
- Added support for the following new metrics:
  - Grouped precision.
  - Precision-at-k.
- `data` module:
  - Added support for loading the extreme classification repository
    datasets (i.e., `data.XCLoader`).
  - Added support for randomly splitting datasets.
