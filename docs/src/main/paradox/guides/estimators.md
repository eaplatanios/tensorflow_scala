# Estimators

## Models

A `Model` needs to implement one or more of the following
methods, depending on their type:

  - **Inference Models** only need to implement a method
    for building all ops used for inference:

    @@snip [Estimators.scala](/docs/src/main/scala/Estimators.scala) { #inference_model }

  - **Trainable Models** also need to implement a method
    for building all ops used for training, and one for
    building all ops used for evaluation:

    @@snip [Estimators.scala](/docs/src/main/scala/Estimators.scala) { #trainable_models }

### Type Parameters

The type parameters of these classes can be broadly
interpreted as follows:

  - `In`: Input type of the model, at inference time (i.e.,
    when the model is being used/deployed).
  - `TrainIn`: Input type of the model, at training time
    (e.g., this could be the model inference inputs along
    with supervision labels).
  - `Out`: Output type of the model, at inference time.
  - `TrainOut`: Output type of the model, at training time.
    Note that this is useful to keep separate from `Out`.
    From example, during training a model may output a
    distribution over some labels whereas during inference
    it may output the single label with the highest
    probability.
  - `Loss`: Type of the loss function value (e.g., `Float`).
  - `EvalIn`: Input type of the model, at evaluation time.

### Ops Classes

Here we describe the ops classes that the `buildXXXOps()`
methods defined above return. In summary, these classes are
wrappers over constructed ops that can be used to perform
inference, training, and evaluation, using models.

The `InferOps` class contains all ops that are used for
inference:

  - `inputIterator: DatasetIterator[In]`: Dataset iterator.
  - `input: In`: Retrieved element from the dataset iterator.
  - `output: Out`: Model inference output.

The `TrainOps` class contains all ops that are used for
training:

  - `inputIterator: DatasetIterator[TrainIn]`: Train dataset iterator.
  - `input: TrainIn`: Retrieved element from the dataset iterator.
  - `output: TrainOut`: Model training output.
  - `loss: Output[Loss]`: Scalar tensor containing the loss value.
  - `gradientsAndVariables: Seq[(OutputLike[Loss], Variable[Any])]`:
    Gradients of the loss along with their corresponding variables.
  - `trainOp: UntypedOp`: Op that when executed performs a single
    training step (e.g., a gradient descent step for a single batch).

The `EvalOps` class contains all ops that are used for
evaluation:

  - `inputIterator: DatasetIterator[In]`: Dataset iterator.
  - `input: In`: Retrieved element from the dataset iterator.
  - `output: Out`: Model evaluation output.
  - `metricValues: Seq[Output[Float]]`: Metric value ops.
  - `metricUpdates: Seq[Output[Float]]`: Metric update ops.
  - `metricResets: Set[UntypedOp]`: Metric reset ops.

Note that the metrics have value, update, and reset ops,
because estimators only use streaming versions of the
metrics.
